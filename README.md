github hates me with a passion~

Chase Hacking here to apologize in advance. Animation and all other forms of art is something I hold very close to my. The way it can tell stories, awe viewers, or serve as a way for the creaters to express themselves, is something I very much want to be a part of. I feel honored to be majoring in animation, and hope to make my professors proud, so I can one day call myself a talented professional. I moved to Utah a couple years ago from Austin Texas, and just recently moved into my first apartment. I hate github with a passion, despite its numerous uses, and I'm a sucker for Jazz music. I'm a Nintendo gaming idiot and I occasionaly love to watch disney classics on VHS when I'm feeling nostalgic or lonley and dark and cold like a bitter abyss (like github). I devote alot of my time to try and make my teachers happy, I can assure you I'm gonna give it my all in this class. I'm obsessed with detail and presentation, and hope to be able to create all the annoying things in my head that won't shut up. 

I hope we can get along very well! Do you know a "Preston Powel" by chance? He knows me, so if you guys are in touch, that's pretty neato.



P.S. I secretly wanna steal one of your 22' Wacom Display screens. I have a solid $20 that I found in an old pair of pants. Let's make a deal.
